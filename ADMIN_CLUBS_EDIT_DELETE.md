## 🔒 Security Considerations

### **Current Implementation**
- ✅ Soft delete preserves data
- ✅ Server-side validation
- ✅ Type-safe API calls
- ✅ Error handling

### **Recommended Additions**
- 🔐 Add authentication checks in API
- 🔐 Verify admin role before allowing edits
- 🔐 Add rate limiting
- 🔐 Log all admin actions
- 🔐 Add CSRF protection
- 🔐 Sanitize input data

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

The edit and delete modals are fully responsive:
- ✅ Mobile-friendly (padding adjustments)
- ✅ Scrollable content on small screens
- ✅ Touch-friendly button sizes
- ✅ Backdrop prevents interaction with background
- ✅ Close button always visible

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Image Warnings**: Using `<img>` tags (NextJS prefers `<Image>`)
   - Images still work fine
   - Consider migrating to next/image for optimization

2. **No Undo**: Once deleted, requires database access to restore
   - Consider implementing soft delete recovery UI

3. **No Validation on API**: Client-side validation only
   - Add server-side validation for production
