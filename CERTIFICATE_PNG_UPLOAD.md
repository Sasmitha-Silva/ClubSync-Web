  <Certificate
    ref={certificateRef}
    userName={user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName}
    eventName={event.title}
    clubName={event.club.name}
    eventDate={event.startDateTime.toISOString()}
    certificateId="" // Auto-generated
  />
</div>

// 3. Generate and upload
const handleIssueCertificate = async () => {
  if (!certificateRef.current) return;
  
  const result = await generateAndSaveCertificate(
    certificateRef.current,
    userId,
    eventId
  );

  if (result.success) {
    console.log('Certificate URL:', result.certificateUrl);
